# News Website

Note: 
- This blog doesn't allow double quotations in title. 
- If you cannot find emails sent by PHPMailer, it is most likely stored in your spam folder. 
- Users can still allowed to read data. Thus, they can see blog posts and comments and search even though they are not logged in. However, they cannot create, update, delete data. 
- Like button is unfinished and it not working. Please ignore it. 
When you go to like.php and check, the buttons are working though. 
- Make sure to log in to send an email. 

1. Added search function 
2. Users can click email button in main.php to send out their posts as emails. PHPMailer was used to implement this function.
